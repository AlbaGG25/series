# TV show finder

Hey there!

The following project is a web site created to help users find new TV shows. 

The project has a search bar to write the title of the show and a search button. This search system allows the user to look for shows by name. 

## Built with:

- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS

## Installation

Use $ git clone (https://github.com/AlbaGG25/series.git)

## Usability

When the user clicks on the search button it will open the results list. The user can select a TV show as a favorite and it will be stored in a list next to the results so the user can check it anytime. The favorite list will remain visible until the user clicks on the TV show cards again to remove them from the list.

If the user hasnÂ´t written anything in the search bar it will generate an error message. 

The project get the series information from an API:
